    Professional Summary of Research Interests and Expertise
    </h2>
  <p>
    I'm a highly motivated and passionate bioinformatician, data scientist and researcher naturally driven by curiosity 
    to use mathematical, statistical and computational methods to answer fundamental and applied research questions 
    in biodiversity science, evolutionary biology, ecology, genomics and bioinformatics, particularly related to 
    molecular species identification and discovery through DNA barcoding and other DNA-based approaches.
